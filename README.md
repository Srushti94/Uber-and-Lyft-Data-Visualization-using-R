Analyzing and visualizing Uber and Lyft dataset from Boston, MA
Introduction
Uber and Lyft are two popular ride-hailing services that allow users to request rides from drivers through their apps. Uber is available in more countries and cities than Lyft, but Lyft has a larger market share in the United States. Both services have similar features, but there are some key differences, such as their pricing models.
We have a dataset of ride data from Boston, Massachusetts. We will use this data to analyze the factors that affect dynamic pricing and to compare the pricing models of Uber and Lyft.
Here are some of the factors that we will consider:
•	Time of day
•	Day of week
•	Location
•	Weather
•	Traffic
We will also consider the influences of surge rate for Lyft
•	Peak hour
•	Traffic
•	Number of available rides in the area
We believe that this analysis will provide valuable insights into the factors that affect dynamic pricing and the differences between Uber and Lyft’s pricing models.

About the data set
The data set is taken from Kaggle. It was collected from 11-26-18 to 12-18-18 in Boston, MA at regular intervals of 5 mins. The data was gathered for Uber and Lyft. It has 637,976 rows of data, the split between Uber and Lyft rides was roughly 50/50. 
NOTE: The data has been collected from different sources, including real-time data collection using Uber and Lyft API (Application Programming Interface) queries. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brllrb/uber-and-lyft-dataset-boston-ma

Conclusion
In this article, we analyzed a dataset of ride-hailing data from Boston, Massachusetts. We found that Uber has more rides than Lyft by a small margin. Uber can be the first choice for long distances. We also found that there is no Lyft product that is more popular than the others. 
We then looked at the factors that influence surge pricing. We found that surge pricing is highest during peak hours, on Tuesdays and Mondays, and for Lyft and Lyft_plus ride options. We also found that surge pricing is lower on Wednesdays and for luxury ride options.
Finally, we looked at the most popular pickup points and drop-off locations. We found that the most popular route is Financial District to Boston University. We also found that people are more likely to use a cab during cold temperatures and when it is windy.
We believe that this analysis provides valuable insights into the factors that affect ride-hailing prices. We hope that this information will be helpful to researchers and analysts who are interested in understanding the ride-hailing industry.

Recommendations
Based on our findings, we recommend the following:
Ride-hailing companies should consider factors such as peak hours, day of the week, and ride options when setting surge prices. 
Ride-hailing companies should work to increase the number of available rides during peak hours to reduce surge pricing. 
Ride-hailing companies should offer discounts or promotions during off-peak hours to encourage riders to use their services at those times. 
Ride-hailing companies should collect more data on ridership patterns to better understand how to set surge prices and increase ridership.
